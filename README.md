# 🌬️ AQI Calculator

A beginner-friendly **Air Quality Index Calculator** web application with a Python backend and React frontend.

---

## 🎯 What Does This App Do?

1. You select a city from a dropdown (67 Indian cities available)
2. You pick a monitoring station from that city
3. The app fetches **real-time air quality data** from OpenAQ
4. Python calculates the Air Quality Index using EPA standards
5. The result comes back with colors (green = good, red = bad) and live measurements

**Features:**
- 🏙️ 691 monitoring stations across India
- 📊 Real-time data from OpenAQ API
- 📈 Individual pollutant breakdowns (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.)
- 📝 Blog section for sharing thoughts on air pollution in India!

## 🏗️ How It's Built

Think of this project as a **restaurant**:

| Component | Restaurant Analogy | Technology | You Know This? |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Frontend** | Dining room (what customers see) | React | ❌ New (but explained!) |
| **Backend** | Kitchen (where food is made) | Python + FastAPI | ✅ Yes! |
| **API** | Waiter (carries orders) | HTTP/JSON | 🔄 Similar to `requests` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally (One Command!)

```bash
# Windows
.\start.bat

# Linux/Mac  
./start.sh
```

**That's it!** Open your browser:
- **App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

The script automatically:
1. Creates Python virtual environment
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Starts both servers

## 🐍 For Python Developers

You already know Python! Here's how this project maps to what you know:

| This Project | Python Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| FastAPI | Like Flask |
| Pydantic models | Like dataclasses with validation |
| `uvicorn.run()` | Like `flask run` |
| React components | Functions that return HTML |
| `fetch()` in JS | `requests.post()` in Python |

**Start here:** Read [PYTHON_GUIDE.md](PYTHON_GUIDE.md) to understand every line of Python code!

## 📊 Understanding the AQI Scale

| AQI | Color | What It Means |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| 0-50 | 🟢 Green | Good - Go outside! |
| 51-100 | 🟡 Yellow | Moderate - Okay for most |
| 101-150 | 🟠 Orange | Unhealthy for sensitive groups |
| 151-200 | 🔴 Red | Unhealthy for everyone |
| 201-300 | 🟣 Purple | Very Unhealthy |
| 301+ | 🟤 Maroon | Hazardous - Stay inside! |

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Why not just use Python for everything?**
> React makes beautiful, interactive UIs easier. The Python backend handles the logic.

**Q: Do I need to learn JavaScript?**
> No! The frontend is ready to use. Focus on the Python code in `backend/`.

**Q: What's FastAPI vs Flask?**
> FastAPI is like a modern Flask - faster, with auto-documentation and data validation.
